## 🚀 How to Run

### From Project Root
```bash
# Start Expo (interactive menu with QR code)
npm run mobile

# Or run directly on platforms:
npm run mobile:web      # Browser
npm run mobile:android  # Android device/emulator
npm run mobile:ios      # iOS device/simulator (Mac only)
```

### From Mobile App Directory
```bash
cd src/mobile-app
npm start              # Interactive menu
npm run web           # Browser
npm run android       # Android
npm run ios           # iOS
```

## 📱 How to View the App

### Option 1: Web Browser (Easiest - Already Running!)
The Expo development server is currently running in the background. Look for output showing a localhost URL (usually `http://localhost:19006` or similar).

1. Check the terminal for the Expo QR code and URL
2. Open your browser to the URL shown
3. You should see the onboarding flow!

### Option 2: Physical Device (Best Experience)
1. Install **Expo Go** from App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android)
2. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal
3. The app will load on your device

### Option 3: Emulator/Simulator
1. Start Android Studio (Android) or Xcode (iOS/Mac)
2. Open your emulator/simulator
3. Run `npm run mobile:android` or `npm run mobile:ios`

## 🎯 What You'll See

### First Launch
1. **Onboarding Screen** - Welcome message with animations
2. **Profile Setup** - Choose an avatar from 8 options
3. **Goals Configuration** - Set your driving goals
4. **Main App** - Access all features

### Main App Features
- **Home Tab**: Your safety score, stats, and recent trips
- **Quests Tab**: Daily challenges to earn rewards
- **Wallet Tab**: Manage SOL tokens and rewards
- **Leaderboard Tab**: See how you rank against other safe drivers
- **Friends Tab**: Connect with other drivers

## 🔧 Customization

### Skip Onboarding (for testing)
The onboarding is currently set to always show. To skip it:
1. Open `src/mobile-app/App.tsx`
2. Find `checkOnboardingStatus` function
3. Uncomment the lines mentioned in comments
4. Or set `setIsOnboardingComplete(true)` to skip

### Change Colors
Edit `src/mobile-app/src/styles/theme.ts` to customize:
- Background gradients
- Accent colors
- Text colors
- Card styles

### Modify Profile Pictures
Replace images in `src/mobile-app/src/assets/profile-pictures/` with your own PNG files.

## 📝 Notes

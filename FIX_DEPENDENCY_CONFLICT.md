# Complete Solution to Fix React/React Native Dependency Conflict

## Problem Summary
The project has a React/React Native dependency conflict where:
- React 19.1.0 is specified (incompatible with React Native 0.73.6)
- React Native 0.73.6 requires React 18.2.0

## Complete Fix Steps

### Step 1: Clear All Cached Dependencies
```bash
# Remove all cached files and dependencies
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -f package-lock.json
rm -f yarn.lock
rm -f pnpm-lock.yaml
rm -rf .cache/
rm -rf .next/
rm -rf build/
rm -rf dist/
```

### Step 2: Verify No Other package.json Files
```bash
# Check for any additional package.json files
find . -name "package.json" -type f
```

### Step 3: Create Clean package.json
The package.json has already been corrected with:
- React: ^18.2.0 (required by React Native 0.73.6)
- React DOM: ^18.2.0
- React Types: ^18.2.45
- React DOM Types: ^18.2.18
- React Native: 0.73.6 (correct version)

### Step 4: Install Clean Dependencies
```bash
# Install with clean dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 5: Verify Installation
```bash
# Check installed versions
npm list react react-native react-dom
```

### Step 6: Test Mobile Build
```bash
# Test mobile app build
cd src/mobile-app
npm install
cd ..
npm run build:mobile
```

## What This Fixes

✅ React 18.2.0 for React Native 0.73.6 compatibility
✅ No more dependency conflicts
✅ Clean installation ready for development
✅ Mobile app will build properly
✅ Backend server remains unaffected

## Files That Were Modified

1. **package.json** - Corrected React versions to 18.2.0
2. All dependencies updated to maintain compatibility

## Verification Commands

After running the fix:
```bash
# Verify React version
npm list react

# Verify React Native version  
npm list react-native

# Check for any remaining conflicts
npm ls
```

This complete solution ensures that:
- The React/React Native dependency conflict is completely resolved
- All cached files are cleared
- The correct versions are installed
- Both backend and mobile components work properly
- No other files are causing conflicts
